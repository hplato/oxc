INSTALLATION
-----------

oxc may be placed anywhere within your file system.
A recommended practice is to place it in /usr/local.

oxc must be started with equivalent access/privs
as the user that executes digitemp.

Start oxc via the command "./oxc.pl" (w/o the quotes)

IMPORTANT: If you are starting oxc from a directory other 
than its installation, you must pass the path to its location.
For example:

/usr/local/oxc/oxc.pl -path=/usr/local/oxc &

More precise control over the lib location and config file
location exists via the lib and config arguments.

All logging is sent to /tmp/oxc.log by default.
You can monitor oxc during execution using the
command "tail -f /tmp/oxc.log".

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Locate your oxc.conf included as a sample in this
release.  Uncomment any properties that you wish 
to override.  Commented properties show the default
values.  Additional notes are included as comments
within this configuration file.

IMPORTANT!! You must specify each sensor and it's
one-wire serial number in the oxc.conf file.  This 
information can be obtained from digitemp's own 
configuration file (albeit in a different format) or
by looking in the owfs mount directory.
